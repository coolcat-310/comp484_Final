# comp484_Final

Final project for COMP 484. This project displays our work for our senior design project which
we name Motion fun. 

The project that we are pursuing is an open-source implementation of interpreting real space into a graphical representation. Current motion capturing technology is expensive and out of reach for most people including students. For example, a two-camera Vicon system with one software license is US$12,500 and MotionBuilder to map the capture data of a character, runs about $4,200 per user. Having access to motion capture technology will facilitate learning for students pursuing degrees in cinema, biology, robotics, kinesiology, physical therapy and many more disciplines. Our goal is to make motion capture technology affordable for students and the general public.
